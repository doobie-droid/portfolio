It explores how numbers are stored in binary, how signed and unsigned integers are represented using bit lengths (8, 16, 32, 64-bit), and how negative numbers use twoâ€™s complement. It explains casting between types, covering safe expansion (e.g., int8 to int16) and risky narrowing (e.g., int16 to int8), which can cause data loss",
